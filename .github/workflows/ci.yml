  # Use alternative image when running on GitHub workflows CI to avoid potential
  # rate limiting when executing jobs in parallel: they can't cache docker images
  # and always pull.
  #
  # To update this image, generate a personal token with write:packages scope
  # on https://github.com/settings/tokens and authenticate yourself locally with
  # "docker login ghcr.io -u <github-username>" using the
  # newly generated token as password.
  # Once logged in, tag an new image:
  #   docker tag shiftcrypto/bitbox-wallet-app:VERSION \
  #     ghcr.io/bitboxswiss/bitbox-wallet-app-ci:VERSION
  # and push as usual:
  #   docker push ghcr.io/bitboxswiss/bitbox-wallet-app-ci:VERSION
  # Lastly, update the next line to use the newly pushed image version.
  # See docs for more details:
  # https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/pushing-and-pulling-docker-images
  #
  # Keep this in sync with default in scripts/github-ci.sh.

We use [https://www.locize.io/](https://www.locize.io/) as a translation service.

Language files are stored in `frontends/web/src/locales`.

The reference language is `en`.

Changing values of any language (reference or otherwise) must be done inside of locize.

Changing values of existing keys must be done inside of locize.io, so the corresponding keys in the
other languages get tagged to be retranslated.

## For repo maintainers

Repo maintainers use [locize-cli](https://github.com/locize/locize-cli). to push/pull translation
files.

Set up `~/.locize` with the following contents:

```
apiKey = <your bitbox-wallet-app api key>
projectId = fe4e5a24-e4a2-4903-96fc-3d62c11fc502
version = latest
```

After adding or removing keys in the reference language: `make locize-push`.

`make locize-push` **does not** update the values of existing keys. In emergencies, use
`locize sync -u true` to force overwrite them.

To pull the files from locize into the repo, use `make locize-pull`.

## For translators

Login to locize.io to the bitbox-wallet-app project.

Experimental: use `make webdev-i18n` to load an inline editor.
